Between StrHashTableCollisionsTest and StrHashTableTest mark StrHashTableCollisionsTest
StrHashTableTest is not strictly necessary and was for personal testing 
StrHashTableCollisionsTest is the most comprehensive one and the assignment says we only need to do it for StrHashTableCollisions anyway.

Debugging is the testing for the StrHashTable
DebuggingCollisions is for testing the StrHashTableCollisions

StrHashTableCollisionsTest has been tested for consistency after adding then removing 2,000,000 entries  
an initial 30 entries was entered then 2,000,000 more added and removed, then the initial 30 checked 
You can run the test yourself by DebuggingCollisions boolean the2000000Test = true;
WARNING it will run for around half an hour good luck
